# Personal-Finance-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing personal finance data using Python. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations such as univariate, bivariate, and multivariate plots to gain insights into financial behavior, spending habits, loan defaults, savings, and investment opportunities.

## Objectives
- Identify customers who are most likely to **default on loans**.  
- Analyze which types of loans are most popular among different **age groups, job types, and regions**.  
- Suggest better **savings and investment plans** for customers.  
- Predict whether a customer will **repay or fail** to repay a loan.  

## Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models (if applied)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development  

## Features
- **Univariate Analysis**: Understanding individual features.  
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Exploring relationships between two variables.  
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Identifying patterns among multiple variables.  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, categorical encoding, and transformations.  
- **Predictive Analysis**: Insights into loan repayment prediction.
